\section{Introduction}
Why is this research important? Is there a bigger phenomenon that this research of yours is part of? Why people in your profession should care about this thesis?

\section{Literature}
What has been done related to this (mainly in academic publications)? What do the authors say about the topic? How does your research question relate to these previous studies? How do you apply them or add to them? Based on what they say, what do you say?  

\section{Research Question}
Based on what other people have studied before, what is the question that no one has really answered yet? What is the main question, and what are perhaps the two or three sub-questions that you need to answer to be able to answer the main question? Be sure of what you write, because you will have to answer to this question ☺

\section{Method}
How do you find an answer to the research question? How do you gather data? From where do you gather data? How do you analyze the data? Out of all the methods in the world, why did you choose this one? What is good about it and what is not? What were the alternative methods, and what were their pros and cons? 

\section{Results}
What is the answer to the research question? What are the answers to the sub-questions? Keep this simple and clear.

\section{Discussion}
How could someone criticize your results? Are they internally valid (the data was gathered and analyzed correctly)? Are the results externally valid (can they be generalized and how)? Based on the results, what can you say about the bigger picture you described in your introduction? How could someone apply your results for further research? Or perhaps apply in a non-research context (e.g., in a company or in everyday life)?

\begin{comment}
KEEP IN MIND!
* A thesis is never read from the beginning to the end in a linear way: write each chapter as a “stand-alone”. 
* Make sure your research question, method, and results form a super clear and clean package: this is the question, this is what I did to find an answer, this is the answer. Your Mom should understand it.
* You will spend most of your sweat in the literature review.
* Choose an audience. Your professor is the most important (and perhaps the only) person who will read the thesis, but have also a wider audience in mind (e.g., colleagues, other professionals).
